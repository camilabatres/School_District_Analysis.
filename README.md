# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of Project 
* We are helping Maria, who works for The City School System, prepare all standarized test scores and funding data for analysis.The data has the Math and Reading scores for each student at every school in the city school system. 

* Before starting the project, I replace the ninth-grade reading and math scores with "NAN = not a number" so thwy wouldn't affect the final results because there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. 

## Results 
### District Summary 
* Below is a screenshot of the results before the 9th grader's scores were replace

*As you can see, there was not a major change on the averages and percentages after we replace the 9th grader's scores with NAN. The averages stayed the same when we round them and % lowered around .1 after the replacement.
